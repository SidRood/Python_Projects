# Python_Projects
This repository includes multiple python coding projects I have created.
The Addition and subtraction file exemplifies simple calculator functions being displayed through a graphic user interface.
I made the Bear Daycare file to immitate the functions of a Tamagotchi where there is a GUI to simulate an arcade game.
